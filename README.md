# dots_new_tab
A new tab page extension that is pretty cool, feel free to use it.

What it does:
It creates circles that get larger, while fading into the background. The circles have varying background images. There is a notepad on the right, and bookmarks on the left.  

More technical:
-Made with canvas and js. (Along with html and css)
-It has only been made for chrome, not Firefox at this point.
